# District-Wise COVID-19 Cases Map
This project creates an interactive choropleth map showing district-wise COVID-19 affected cases in Bangladesh. The map uses Folium and GeoJSON data to visualize the data with clear color intensity for better analysis.  

**Features**  
Interactive map with district-level COVID-19 data.
Log-scaled color intensity for better differentiation.
Tooltips showing district names and case counts.
Exportable as an HTML file for sharing and offline viewing.  
**Requirements**  
Python 3.x
Libraries: folium, branca, numpy, geopandas   
**Steps to Use**  
Load your district-wise COVID-19 data in a GeoJSON-compatible format.
Run the code to generate the interactive map.
The map is saved as an HTML file (district_wise_covid_map.html).
Download and open the HTML file in any web browser to view the map.  
**Output**  
The map shows districts colored based on the number of COVID-19 cases till 1st-31st July, 2020. Darker colors represent higher case counts, and tooltips provide detailed information for each district.
